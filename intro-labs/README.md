# Intro Labs: Delegated Authorization using OAuth 2.0

The intro labs are containing the following demos:

* [Authorization Code Grant Flow Demo](auth-code-demo)
* [Connecting a client app to GitHub API using OAuth 2.0](github-client)

The first one shows all steps of the authorization code grant flow
in detail to understand how this flow works. This is important for other concepts
that are built upon this flow like the PKCE addition or OpenID Connect.

The second one shows how the common predefined OAuth2 clients
of spring security 5 can be used to quickly build clients
for well known providers like GitHub, Google or Facebook.
