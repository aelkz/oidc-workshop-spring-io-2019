# Initial library server application

This is the initial library resource server application that is the starting point
for the hands-on part to implement an OAuth2/OIDC resource server.

The completed reference for the resource server (based on this initial application) 
can be found [here](../library-server-complete-custom/README.md).

See [Spring Security 5 resource server](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#oauth2resourceserver) 
for details on how to build and configure a resource server.
